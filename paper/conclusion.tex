\chapter{Conclusion}

%TODO: fix conclusion
In conclusion, we have shown that deep learning techniques can be successfully applied to biology.
In particular, computational biologists should start using \glspl{ae} (especially \glspl{vae}) for dimensionality reduction instead of defaulting to using \gls{pca}.
Among our contributions are the new loss function that we developed for our \gls{vae}, which is general enough to be used with any biological data and the set of new \gls{ecoli} \gls{cfps} metabolic models.
We hope this work encourages other computational biologists to continue work integrating deep learning with biology in general and metabolic models specifically.
