# Files
- cf_io: the main IO file. Loads and writes the CFPS experimental setups and experimental data. Also used to read in flux data and trained VAEs.
- convert: contains the functions that convert a regular GEM into something that more closely resembles a CFPS.
- correlation: used to assess our models by calculating how well the generated models describe actual experimental data.
- datasets: create or write a flux dataset.
- fba_utils: general utility functions for FBA models. Contains code to manipulate objective functions, concentrations, and fluxes.
- flux_sample: creates the unique models based on experimental conditions from a base model and then samples flux datasets from them.
- julia_to_cobra: helper code to convert Varner models written in Julia to COBRApy models.
- plotting: tools to make plots of the latent spaces of PCA and VAEs
- threshold: used in conjuction with correlation.py, produces the reduced GEMs based on a trained VAE
- utils: miscellaneous tools for use with FBA models and flux datasets
- vae: all code relating to VAEs
